- Create a data folder where we want to store the data
- Run the following command
    > mongod --dbpath=data
    No spaces before and after '=' in --dbpath=data

    It will start the mongodb server inside the data folder,
    ab jo bhi data store hoga vo hoga inside the data folder 

Reference: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/
Or npm js docs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb

To check server is running or not
- In browser open: localhost:27017

Message comes: It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port.
That means mongodb server is running perfectly fine.

Then in new terminal, without closing the previous one
- Run the following command
    > mongosh
