                C++ is a high-performance, compiled, general-purpose programming language that was developed by
                Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It was designed to
                add object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C. C++ is a powerful language that
                is used for developing applications, systems software, and games.
