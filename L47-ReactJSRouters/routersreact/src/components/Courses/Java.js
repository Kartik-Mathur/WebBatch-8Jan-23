            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed
                to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
                developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run
                on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
