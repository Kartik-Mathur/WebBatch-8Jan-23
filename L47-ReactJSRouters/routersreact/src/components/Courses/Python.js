            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
                with the use of significant indentation. Python is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented
                programming, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It is often used for web development,
                scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>
            <h2>Features of Python</h2>
            <ul>
                <li className='course-feature-link'>Easy to Learn: Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to learn,
                    making it a great language for beginners.</li>
                <li className='course-feature-link'>High-Level Language: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away
                    many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their code.</li>
                <li className='course-feature-link'>Interpreted Language: Python code is interpreted rather than compiled, making it
                    easy to write and test code.</li>
                <li className='course-feature-link'>Object-Oriented: Python is an object-oriented language, which means it organ
                    izes code into objects that contain data and functions that operate on that data.</li>
                <li className='course-feature-link'>Large Standard Library: Python has a large and comprehensive standard
                    library that includes modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking,
                    and data structures.</li>
